    <h1>CSS Examples</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Example 1</h2>
        <p>
            The default background colour and text colour has been changed within the CSS for the html element,
            creating a dark-mode style appearance.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Example 2</h2>
        <p>
            I have created CSS for a div with the class "container" to create a slightly lighter box than the main
            background colour which visually separates each CSS example. They fit the sizze of the contents, with a
            width up to a maximum of 50% of the window width. They also have a rounnded border and a dropshadow to make
            them stand out more on the background of the page.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
        <h2 id="head2-change-1">Example 3</h2>
        <p>
            I have made a change to the CSS for the above heading ("Example 3") which is given the id "head2-change-1"
            to make specifically this instance larger than a normal instance of the h2 element (see titles for above
            examples for reference of original size). I have also made the title a different colour to the default, to
            show that the override only changes the one h2 instance.
