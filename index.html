    <h1>CSS Examples</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Example 1: background and text colour</h2>
        <p>
            The default background colour and text colour has been changed within the CSS for the html element,
            creating a dark-mode style appearance.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Example 2: containers for examples</h2>
        <p>
            I have created CSS for a div with the class "container" to create a slightly lighter box than the main
            background colour which visually separates each CSS example. They fit the size of the contents, with a
            width up to a maximum of 50% of the window width. They also have a rounded border and a dropshadow to make
            them stand out more on the background of the page.
            <br>
            The width is also given a minimum, so that it isn't any smaller than 25% of the window.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
        <h2 id="head2-change-1">Example 3: id changed element (heading)</h2>
        <p>
            I have made a change to the CSS for the above heading ("Example 3") which is given the id "head2-change-1"
            to make specifically this instance larger than a normal instance of the h2 element (see titles for above
            examples for reference of original size). I have also made the title a different colour to the default, to
            show that the override only changes the one h2 instance.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="container2">
        <h2>Example 4: alternate container using a different class</h2>
        <p>
            This example shows a separate div using the class "container2" which is the same as others except it is
            instead slightly darker than the background instead of lighter, the header colour is changed to aqua (as
            will all headers within a "container2" div) and all text within p elements within a "container2" div are
            automatically made bold.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Example 5: different ways to define colours</h2>
        <p>
            This example shows that colours can be defined in multiple ways, as in the CSS the names for each will be
            different colours and use the respective methods. The methods are <span class="RGB">Red/Green/Blue</span>,
            <span class="HEX">hex code</span>, <span class="HSL">Hue/Saturation/Lightness</span>, <span
                class="RGBA">Red/Green/Blue/Alpha</span>, <span class="HSLA">Hue/Saturation/Lightness/Alpha</span>, and
            <span class="colour-name">colour name</span>. Colour can be applied to text, the background, to a border,
            or to many other things for different effects.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            - <span class="RGB">Red/Green/Blue</span> (or RGB) works by providing a value from 0 to 255 for the channels
            of red green and blue, which is how light combines into various colours as those are the primary colours of
            light (or "additive colour mixing"). This is also used by <span class="RGBA">Red/Green/Blue/Alpha</span> (or
            RGBA) but the added channel "Alpha" is used for transparency, with a value from 0.0 (completely transparent)
            to 1.0 (fully opaque).
        </p>
        <p>
            - <span class="HEX">Hex code</span> is one of the most used ways to describe colour for computers. It is
            seen as a # symbol followed by 6 "digits" of haxadecimal (numbers form 0-9 and letters from a-f to represent
            numbers from 10-15, with 10 in hexadecimal being the same as 16 in decimal). Each group of 2 digits is used
            for the same channels as RGB in order. So since the colour being used to represent hex codes in this example
            is #3aefeb it is equivalent to an RGB value of [58,239,235] which makes it the light blue/green colour that
            you see. Hex codes are also able to use the alpha channel by adding another 2 digits to the code, with
            higher values being more opaque and lower values being more transparent.
        </p>
        <p>
            - <span class="HSL">Hue/Saturation/Lightness</span> (HSL) and <span
                class="HSLA">Hue/Saturation/Lightness/Alpha</span> (HSLA) are in contrast less widely used. The value
            for Hue goes through each colour ranging from 0 to 359 (0 is the same as 360, being red, and all other
            values are a different part of the light spectrum), and the Saturation and Lightness values range from 0% to
            100%. HSLA is like RGBA in which it also adds in the Alpha channel, with the same value range.
        </p>
        <p>
            - The web also has 140 <span class="colour-name">colour names</span> that are supported by all browsers,
            which are symbols pointing to predefined hex code values. The colour used to represent colour names for this
            example is magenta, which means it is the equivalent of #ff00ff.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container3">
        <h2>Example 6: background images</h2>
        <p>
            This example shows that it is also possible to use an image for a background in a container instead of just
            a colour.
            <br><br>
            The background image is also capable of being repeated (such as for a tileable pattern you want to use for a
            given box or container) or it can be set to not do so. It is also possible to only set it to repeat either
            horizontally or vertically.
            <br><br>
            If the background is set to not be repeated, then the rest of the backgorund will be set to look the same as
            the background behind the element being assigned an image, unless it is also given a background colour,
            which will show behind the image so a background colour would only show if the image is either transparent
            or doesn't fill the whole box similar to how this one has a sunset that doesn't fill the box.
            <br><br>
            There is also a property for changing the size of the background, so it could make a background image match
            the size of the element it is assigned to. This is set to "contain" in this example so that the image is
            made larger so that its height matches the container while keeping the same proportions so the width doesn't
            make it look squashed or stretched.
        </p>
        <p>
            This example also gives the text a dark shadow so that it is somewhat easier to read with the image behind
            it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container4">
        <h2>Example 7: element borders</h2>
        <p>
            Borders can be given to elements, and can be styled in many ways. The other examples don't have a border,
            while this one shoes the border styled as dashed while being cyan in colour. All examples also have a border
            radius which rounds the corners of the boxes, making them smoother to look at. A short hand property is also
            available to combine each border property at once (ordered as width, style, colour).
            <br><br>
            The border width is also able to be changed, so that it can be made to stand out more or to be more subtle.
            <br><br>
            Borders can also be styled to be hidden in case an element you don't want to have a border is inheriting one
            from somewhere else.
            <br><br>
            Each separate side of the border is capable of being defined separately for each property (such as if you
            wanted the bottom border to be a double line)
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container auto-margin">
        <h2>Example 8: margins</h2>
        <p>
            Margins change the position of the element they are applied to. This example shows the margin changed so
            that the left and right margins have the value auto, which causes the container to be rendered in the center
            of the page. It also has a larger gap between it and the other examples.
            <br><br>
            This example is done by making use of assignment of multiple classes, using the base "container" class and
            an extra "auto-margin" class.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container big-padding">
        <h2>Example 9: padding</h2>
        <p>
            Padding is used for setting the distance between the edge of the container and the content. This example
            shows a larger padding than the rest of the examples.
            <br>
            It is possible to apply padding to only specific sides, although I am using the shorthand to apply 40px of
            padding to the top and bottom, while applying 100px padding to the left and right. This makes the container
            for this example wider than the others.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container more-size">
        <h2>Example 10: differing height and width</h2>
        <p>
            This example shows that the height and width of an element can be altered, as the container uses the
            existing base "container" class and one which sets a specific height, causing it to be larger than it would
            be if it was set to fit its contents.
            <br>
            However, when viewed with a window that has a thin enough width, the text will instead overflow the
            container.
            <br><br>
            The max width has also been changed to go up to a maximum of 75% of the window's width, which causes it to
            be longer than other examples due to still being set to fit the content.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Example 11: Text</h2>
        <p class="all-text">
            The text within this example is set to show many different ways to alter text. This includes, but is not
            limited to, the text's colour (represented here by being magenta), the text align property causing it to be
            aligned to the right instead of the left, a wavy underline in cyan for text decoration (which can be done
            either through a single property or deparate properties that do individual parts of the combined one), a
            text indent which causes the first line to be indented (despite being aligned right, it indents from the
            left), and an increased letter spacing which causes each letter to be further apart from others around them.
        </p>
        <p class="high-line">
            This text has been given an increased line height, which is difficult to see without a good amount of text,
            so it will be followed by some Lorem ipsum text.
            <br>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Fusce id accumsan enim, ut auctor massa. Curabitur
            ac porttitor nisi. Morbi venenatis, justo ut dictum lacinia, enim ex fermentum tortor, vitae dignissim nulla
            magna ut dolor. Suspendisse potenti. Aenean congue lorem nec lectus maximus venenatis. Donec id risus vel
            tellus auctor gravida. Donec tempor elit eget nisi faucibus, in faucibus orci convallis. Aenean malesuada
            neque erat, sit amet convallis urna consectetur vel.
        </p>
        <p class="capital">
            This text was written to be normal, but has been given the "text-transform" property with the value
            "capitalize" which causes each word to be capitalised. It also has options for forcing the text to be all
            lowercase, all uppercase, or none in case it is inheriting a transformation from a parent and you don't want
            it to.
        </p>
        <p class="right-to-left">
            This text is given the direction of right to left, and is given the "unicode-bidi" property with the
            "bidi-override" value in order to cause the text to be mirrored (but not the letters themselves). If you can
            read this properly, then you either have a mirror or are good at reversing things in your head.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other properties that can be used are: word spacing (increasing or reducing the space between words), white
            space (which can specify how whitespace is handled in various ways), text shadow (to add a shadow to the
            text), and more.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2 class="head-font">Example 12: fonts</h2>
        <p class="para-font">
            Using the font-family property, it is possible to change the font that text is rendered with, as seen by how
            the fonts in this example are different to the fonts in other examples, most notably the lack of serifs for
            this example. The heading is also a different font from the paragraph.
            <br>
            It is also possible to use font-style to make an entire element's text show in italics, and font-weight to
            change how thick or thin the lettering is for the text.
        </p>
        <p class="para-font-2">
            The above text makes use of fonts that can come pre-installed with a web browser, but this text instead uses
            a font that has been downloaded and provided within the website's files named "ComicRelief-Regular". If the
            browser this is being viewed in is not compatible with .ttf files for fonts, you will instead see the
            "sans-serif" font that comes pre-installed on browsers.
            <br>
            It is also possible for outside fonts to be added through a ling to the repository holding it, so that it
            doesn't have to be downloaded to the website's files directly.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Example 13: Icons</h2>
        <p>
            There are a number of ways that icons can be implemented. One way is through the use of Font Awesome Icons, which are able to show icons like a house for a home button (<i class="fa-solid fa-house"></i>), a thumbs up for a like button (<i class="fa-solid fa-thumbs-up"></i>), and many many more such as logos for various companies or social medias that may be linked to by a website.
            <br>
            Other options are using Google Icons, which has many icons for making various buttons, and Bootstrap Icons which similarly to the other 2 options has many icons for various purposes.
            <br>
            Font Awesome is also able to apply animations to icons, so it is possible to have a red beating heart as shown here: <i class="fa-solid fa-heart fa-beat" style="color: #d50000;"></i>
            <br>
            It also has a number of icons that require the use of a paid plan, and within the list of icons those are given a "pro" label.
        </p>
        <p>
            As icons are added within text, they can be manipulated in the same way that text can (such as altering the size, colour, and using them for the "text" of an a element for a link).
            <br>
            Each of these ways to use icons use SVG files (or "Scalable Vector Graphics" files) which means they don't lose their resolution or definition when increased in size.
