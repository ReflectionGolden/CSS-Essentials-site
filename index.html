    <h1>CSS Examples</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Example 1: background and text colour</h2>
        <p>
            The default background colour and text colour has been changed within the CSS for the html element,
            creating a dark-mode style appearance.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Example 2: containers for examples</h2>
        <p>
            I have created CSS for a div with the class "container" to create a slightly lighter box than the main
            background colour which visually separates each CSS example. They fit the size of the contents, with a
            width up to a maximum of 50% of the window width. They also have a rounded border and a dropshadow to make
            them stand out more on the background of the page.
            <br>
            The width is also given a minimum, so that it isn't any smaller than 25% of the window.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
        <h2 id="head2-change-1">Example 3: id changed element (heading)</h2>
        <p>
            I have made a change to the CSS for the above heading ("Example 3") which is given the id "head2-change-1"
            to make specifically this instance larger than a normal instance of the h2 element (see titles for above
            examples for reference of original size). I have also made the title a different colour to the default, to
            show that the override only changes the one h2 instance.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="container2">
        <h2>Example 4: alternate container using a different class</h2>
        <p>
            This example shows a separate div using the class "container2" which is the same as others except it is
            instead slightly darker than the background instead of lighter, the header colour is changed to aqua (as
            will all headers within a "container2" div) and all text within p elements within a "container2" div are
            automatically made bold.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Example 5: different ways to define colours</h2>
        <p>
            This example shows that colours can be defined in multiple ways, as in the CSS the names for each will be
            different colours and use the respective methods. The methods are <span class="RGB">Red/Green/Blue</span>,
            <span class="HEX">hex code</span>, <span class="HSL">Hue/Saturation/Lightness</span>, <span
                class="RGBA">Red/Green/Blue/Alpha</span>, <span class="HSLA">Hue/Saturation/Lightness/Alpha</span>, and
            <span class="colour-name">colour name</span>. Colour can be applied to text, the background, to a border,
            or to many other things for different effects.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="RGB">Red/Green/Blue</span> (or RGB) works by providing a value from 0 to 255 for the
                channels of red green and blue, which is how light combines into various colours as those are the
                primary colours of light (or "additive colour mixing"). This is also used by <span
                    class="RGBA">Red/Green/Blue/Alpha</span> (or RGBA) but the added channel "Alpha" is used for
                transparency, with a value from 0.0 (completely transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque). The alpha channel
                can be seen in action when Example 16.1 overlaps with another example, as you will be able to see
                through it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="HEX">Hex code</span> is one of the most used ways to describe colour for computers. It is
                seen as a # symbol followed by 6 "digits" of haxadecimal (numbers form 0-9 and letters from a-f to
                represent numbers from 10-15, with 10 in hexadecimal being the same as 16 in decimal). Each group of 2
                digits is used for the same channels as RGB in order. So since the colour being used to represent hex
                codes in this example is #3aefeb it is equivalent to an RGB value of [58,239,235] which makes it the
                light blue/green colour that you see. Hex codes are also able to use the alpha channel by adding another
                2 digits to the code, with higher values being more opaque and lower values being more transparent.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="HSL">Hue/Saturation/Lightness</span> (HSL) and <span
                    class="HSLA">Hue/Saturation/Lightness/Alpha</span> (HSLA) are in contrast less widely used. The
                value for Hue goes through each colour ranging from 0 to 359 (0 is the same as 360, being red, and all
                other values are a different part of the light spectrum), and the Saturation and Lightness values range
                from 0% to 100%. HSLA is like RGBA in which it also adds in the Alpha channel, with the same value
                range.
            </li>
            <li>
                The web also has 140 <span class="colour-name">colour names</span> that are supported by all browsers,
                which are symbols pointing to predefined hex code values. The colour used to represent colour names for
                this example is magenta, which means it is the equivalent of #ff00ff.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="container3">
        <h2>Example 6: background images</h2>
        <p>
            This example shows that it is also possible to use an image for a background in a container instead of just
            a colour.
            <br><br>
            The background image is also capable of being repeated (such as for a tileable pattern you want to use for a
            given box or container) or it can be set to not do so. It is also possible to only set it to repeat either
            horizontally or vertically.
            <br><br>
            If the background is set to not be repeated, then the rest of the backgorund will be set to look the same as
            the background behind the element being assigned an image, unless it is also given a background colour,
            which will show behind the image so a background colour would only show if the image is either transparent
            or doesn't fill the whole box similar to how this one has a sunset that doesn't fill the box.
            <br><br>
            There is also a property for changing the size of the background, so it could make a background image match
            the size of the element it is assigned to. This is set to "contain" in this example so that the image is
            made larger so that its height matches the container while keeping the same proportions so the width doesn't
            make it look squashed or stretched.
        </p>
        <p>
            This example also gives the text a dark shadow so that it is somewhat easier to read with the image behind
            it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container4">
        <h2>Example 7: element borders</h2>
        <p>
            Borders can be given to elements, and can be styled in many ways. The other examples don't have a border,
            while this one shoes the border styled as dashed while being cyan in colour. All examples also have a border
            radius which rounds the corners of the boxes, making them smoother to look at. A short hand property is also
            available to combine each border property at once (ordered as width, style, colour).
            <br><br>
            The border width is also able to be changed, so that it can be made to stand out more or to be more subtle.
            <br><br>
            Borders can also be styled to be hidden in case an element you don't want to have a border is inheriting one
            from somewhere else.
            <br><br>
            Each separate side of the border is capable of being defined separately for each property (such as if you
            wanted the bottom border to be a double line)
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container auto-margin">
        <h2>Example 8: margins</h2>
        <p>
            Margins change the position of the element they are applied to. This example shows the margin changed so
            that the left and right margins have the value auto, which causes the container to be rendered in the center
            of the page. It also has a larger gap between it and the other examples.
            <br><br>
            This example is done by making use of assignment of multiple classes, using the base "container" class and
            an extra "auto-margin" class.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container big-padding">
        <h2>Example 9: padding</h2>
        <p>
            Padding is used for setting the distance between the edge of the container and the content. This example
            shows a larger padding than the rest of the examples.
            <br>
            It is possible to apply padding to only specific sides, although I am using the shorthand to apply 40px of
            padding to the top and bottom, while applying 100px padding to the left and right. This makes the container
            for this example wider than the others.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container more-size">
        <h2>Example 10: differing height and width</h2>
        <p>
            This example shows that the height and width of an element can be altered, as the container uses the
            existing base "container" class and one which sets a specific height, causing it to be larger than it would
            be if it was set to fit its contents.
            <br>
            However, when viewed with a window that has a thin enough width, the text will instead overflow the
            container.
            <br><br>
            The max width has also been changed to go up to a maximum of 75% of the window's width, which causes it to
            be longer than other examples due to still being set to fit the content.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Example 11: Text</h2>
        <p class="all-text">
            The text within this example is set to show many different ways to alter text. This includes, but is not
            limited to, the text's colour (represented here by being magenta), the text align property causing it to be
            aligned to the right instead of the left, a wavy underline in cyan for text decoration (which can be done
            either through a single property or deparate properties that do individual parts of the combined one), a
            text indent which causes the first line to be indented (despite being aligned right, it indents from the
            left), and an increased letter spacing which causes each letter to be further apart from others around them.
        </p>
        <p class="high-line">
            This text has been given an increased line height, which is difficult to see without a good amount of text,
            so it will be followed by some Lorem ipsum text.

            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Fusce id accumsan enim, ut auctor massa. Curabitur
            ac porttitor nisi. Morbi venenatis, justo ut dictum lacinia, enim ex fermentum tortor, vitae dignissim nulla
            magna ut dolor. Suspendisse potenti. Aenean congue lorem nec lectus maximus venenatis. Donec id risus vel

            neque erat, sit amet convallis urna consectetur vel.
        </p>
        <p class="capital">
            This text was written to be normal, but has been given the "text-transform" property with the value
            "capitalize" which causes each word to be capitalised. It also has options for forcing the text to be all
            lowercase, all uppercase, or none in case it is inheriting a transformation from a parent and you don't want
            it to.
        </p>
        <p class="right-to-left">
            This text is given the direction of right to left, and is given the "unicode-bidi" property with the
            "bidi-override" value in order to cause the text to be mirrored (but not the letters themselves). If you can
            read this properly, then you either have a mirror or are good at reversing things in your head.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other properties that can be used are: word spacing (increasing or reducing the space between words), white
            space (which can specify how whitespace is handled in various ways), text shadow (to add a shadow to the
            text), and more.

    <div class="container">
        <h2 class="head-font">Example 12: fonts</h2>
        <p class="para-font">
            Using the font-family property, it is possible to change the font that text is rendered with, as seen by how
            the fonts in this example are different to the fonts in other examples, most notably the lack of serifs for
            this example. The heading is also a different font from the paragraph.
            <br>
            It is also possible to use font-style to make an entire element's text show in italics, and font-weight to
            change how thick or thin the lettering is for the text.
        </p>
        <p class="para-font-2">
            The above text makes use of fonts that can come pre-installed with a web browser, but this text instead uses
            a font that has been downloaded and provided within the website's files named "ComicRelief-Regular". If the
            browser this is being viewed in is not compatible with .ttf files for fonts, you will instead see the
            "sans-serif" font that comes pre-installed on browsers.
            <br>
            It is also possible for outside fonts to be added through a ling to the repository holding it, so that it
            doesn't have to be downloaded to the website's files directly.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Example 13: Icons</h2>
        <p>
            There are a number of ways that icons can be implemented. One way is through the use of Font Awesome Icons,
            which are able to show icons like a house for a home button (<i class="fa-solid fa-house"></i>), a thumbs up
            for a like button (<i class="fa-solid fa-thumbs-up"></i>), and many many more such as logos for various
            companies or social medias that may be linked to by a website.
            <br>
            Other options are using Google Icons, which has many icons for making various buttons, and Bootstrap Icons
            which similarly to the other 2 options has many icons for various purposes.
            <br>
            Font Awesome is also able to apply animations to icons, so it is possible to have a red beating heart as
            shown here: <i class="fa-solid fa-heart fa-beat" style="color: #d50000;"></i>
            <br>
            It also has a number of icons that require the use of a paid plan, and within the list of icons those are
            given a "pro" label.
        </p>
        <p>
            As icons are added within text, they can be manipulated in the same way that text can (such as altering the
            size, colour, and using them for the "text" of an a element for a link).
            <br>
            Each of these ways to use icons use SVG files (or "Scalable Vector Graphics" files) which means they don't
            lose their resolution or definition when increased in size.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Example 14: Links</h2>
        <p>
            Links (using the "a" tag) are easily made to look different from how they normally do via using text related
            properties.
            <br>
            For an example, <a href="https://bing.com" target="_blank">here is a link</a> (which opens a new tab in
            Bing, so that it shows as unvisited) that uses the default style for a link. In comparison, <a
                href="https://bing.com" target="_blank" class="custom-link">This link</a> goes to the same place, but
            has been changed so that it is a dark aqua colour, doesn't have an underline, has a different font to the
            surrounding text, and is bold. It is also possible to make a link change when it is different states (normal
            otherwise known as "link", visited, hovered, and active), which you can see if you do each with the second
            link.
            <br><br>
            When the second link is hovered over, it will become lighter and get an underline the colour of the normal
            text while seeming to lift off the page due to getting a text shadow with a short transition to the new
            state. Also, while "active" (which means in the process of being clicked on) the link returns to the darker
            colour and the shadow recedes to suggest it is being clicked and held down but the bottom border stays.
            Finally, once the link has been visited it will turn a dark red when not hovered over or activated.
            <br><br>
            In the CSS, the styles need to be done in order of "link, visited, hover, active" but they aren't all needed
            at once if you only want to change a the hover and active states, for example.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Example 15: Lists</h2>
        <p>
            There are various types of lists available for use in a web page, and CSS can style them in various ways.
            Here we have an "Ordered List", marked to show an order:
        </p>
        <ol class="roman-list">
            <li>
                This list has been styled so that it is marked with roman numerals, as opposed to the default numbers.
            </li>
            <li>
                This means that you will see that before each part of the list.
            </li>
            <li>
                this creates the appearacne of a specific order required, and can be used for things like steps for
                doing something.
            </li>
            <li>
                The use of roman numerals can work well for a website with that sort of theme, although it is better to
                make use of arabic numbers (1, 5, 10, etc.) as they are more intuitive for most people.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The list of options for different ordered list styles are as follows, in alphabetical order of name:
        </p>
        <ol class="ordered-types-list">
            <li>
                "armenian", which uses traditional Armenian numbering.
            </li>
            <li>
                "decimal", which is a decimal number and the default for an ordered list.
            </li>
            <li>
                "decimal-leading-zero", a decimal number with a leading zeros, such as 01, 02, 03, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                "georgian", which uses traditional Georgian numbering.
            </li>
            <li>
                "lower-alpha", lower case use of english letters.
            </li>
            <li>
                "lower-greek", lower case use of greek letters, such as α, β, γ, δ, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                "lower-latin", which displays the same as lower-alpha.
            </li>
            <li>
                "lower-roman", which uses roman numerals with the letters used in lower case (such as i, ii, iii, iv).
            </li>
            <li>
                "upper-alpha", upper case use of english letters.
            </li>
            <li>
                "upper-greek", upper case use of greek letters, such as Α, Β, Γ, Δ, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                "upper-latin", which displays the same as upper-alpha.
            </li>
            <li>
                "upper-roman", which uses roman numerals with the letters used in upper case (such as I, II, III, IV).
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            And here, we have an "unordered list", marked without showing a specific order:
        </p>
        <ul class="circle-list">
            <li>
                This list has been styled so that it is marked with circles that aren't filled in, as opposed to the
                default bullet points.
            </li>
            <li>
                This means that the list shows differently to normal.
            </li>
            <li>
                as an unordered list, it is just a general list of things with no specific order, so it can be used for
                lists of related pieces of information that don't need to go in any specific order.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The following is a list of some options for using with an unordered list:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                "circle", which shows a circle that isn't filled in.
            </li>
            <li>
                "disc", the default filed in bullet point.
            </li>
            <li>
                "square", a filled in square bullet point.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It is possible to use options intended for ordered lists with unordered lists and vice versa, although it is
            better to keep them for the specific type of list they are for.
            <br><br>
            There are also a few extra list styles, as there is "none" which removes markers before each item, and also
            a way to use images instead for a custom marker in the case of a website with a very specific theme.
            <br><br>
            Lists are most used for containing the navigation at the top of the page, showing the links for each page so
            that the user can go between them. This site does not have muultiple pages, so there isn't an example here,
            but you can see it used by looking at the navigation for my <a
                href="https://github.com/ReflectionGolden/ITOL-practical-site-one" target="_blank"
                class="useful-link"><i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i>ITOL-practical-site-one</a> on GitHub.

        <h2>Example 16: Position</h2>
        <p>
            The position property can be used to change where different elements appear within their container. For most
            elements that this would be used for, it would define their position within the window itself, but for this
            example there is a box within this example's container which will contain a different element for each
            position.
            <br>
            Each box contains text stating what the position value is for that box.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The static value is the default position value, and causes elements to follow the natural flow of the
                page so each one is shown on top of each other in the order they are in the HTML, and causes elements to
                not be affected by the other "positioning properties" (top, bottom, left, or right). It also always
                shows "behind" overlapped elements, even if it is placed after them in the HTML, this being because it
                doesn't count as "positioned".
            </li>
            <li>
                The relative value is the same as static, except that the element can be affected by positioning
                properties, as can be seen with the blue box in the example area.
            </li>
            <li>
                The fixed position, instead of causing the element to follow the page, uses the positioning properties
                to show the element as fixed to the viewport, not moving when you scroll up or down. This can be seen
                with Example 16.1, which has the transparent green background (so that you can still see what is behind
                it) and has been in the top right of the screen instead of inside the example area.
            </li>
            <li>
                The absolute position is much like Fixed, except that instead of being relative to the viewport, it is
                positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor, meaning that if it is within an element which
                has a position property other than static (which the example area has a position property of relative,
                with no positioning properties used) it uses that element for the positioning properties. You will see
                the yellow box is in the bottom right of the example area.
                <br>
                If there was no positioned ancestor, it would instead use the document body, and move with page
                scrolling, so if the example area was static then the yellow box would be in the bottom right if the
                page was scrolled all the way to the top.
            </li>
            <li>
                The sticky position acts like the relative position, but if it is given a top positioning property then
                when you scroll past it then it sticks to the viewport using that positioning property for the distance
                from the top while staying within the parent container (and not moving past the bottom of it).
            </li>
        </ul>

    <div class="container full-wide">
        <h2>Example 17: Z-index</h2>
        <p>
            The z-index property is able to change in what order positioned elements are shown separately from the order they are in the HTML. As an example, the images below were added with "image 1" first and "image 2" second, but the first is shown above the second dues to being given a Z-index of 1.
            <br><br>
            It is possible for the z-index to go all the way up to 1000 and down to -1000, for a total of 2001 z-index layers (including the default of 0). This can be made use of if there are many elements that you want to position in various ways.
            <br>
            Also in the example area, is a venn diagram with 3 circles, each with a thin black border and a transparent background of Red, Green, or Blue while on a background of white. The order they were written in the HTML is the red circle, then the blue, then the green, then the white background. However, the z-index property has been used to show them all in the opposite order, with the white background first, then the green, blue, then red circles.

        <h2>Example 18: Display Property</h2>
        <p>
            The display property is the first piece of CSS that won't be given visual examples due to being mostly for full pages, but this example will still give details on each form of display.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The deafault display of an element is either block, or inline.
            </li>
            <li>
                Block elements (by default) take up the full available width and any elements after them are placed immediately below them, with some examples of elements that are by default "block-level" are the div, the header elements (h1 to h6), p, and so on.
            </li>
            <li>
                Inline, in contrast, doesn't start a new line and only takes up as much space as is required for the content within it. some examples are the span and a elements, which can be used within paragraphs of text to either change the CSS styling of individual words or phrases with span, or turn specific words (like a company name) into a link to another page.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using CSS, it is possible to change the display property, with a number of options. One option is "none", which hides the element and can be used with a button and javascript to hide and show the element by changing it between "display: none;" and some other display value. This can be done similarly using "visibility: hidden;", however instead of it being as if the element was never there, it instead just makes it invisible which means the space it would have taken up shows as blank.
            </li>
            <li>
                There are also display values for various layouts such as grid, flex, and similar which can be both block-level and inline-level and confer different ways that it can be displayed such as allowing or disallowing different CSS properties from altering the element.
            </li>
