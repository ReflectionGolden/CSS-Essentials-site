    <h1>CSS Examples</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Example 1</h2>
        <p>
            The default background colour and text colour has been changed within the CSS for the html element,
            creating a dark-mode style appearance.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Example 2</h2>
        <p>
            I have created CSS for a div with the class "container" to create a slightly lighter box than the main
            background colour which visually separates each CSS example. They fit the sizze of the contents, with a
            width up to a maximum of 50% of the window width. They also have a rounnded border and a dropshadow to make
            them stand out more on the background of the page.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
        <h2 id="head2-change-1">Example 3</h2>
        <p>
            I have made a change to the CSS for the above heading ("Example 3") which is given the id "head2-change-1"
            to make specifically this instance larger than a normal instance of the h2 element (see titles for above
            examples for reference of original size). I have also made the title a different colour to the default, to
            show that the override only changes the one h2 instance.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="container2">
        <h2>Example 4</h2>
        <p>
            This example shows a separate div using the class "container2" which is the same as others except it is
            instead slightly darker than the background instead of lighter, the header colour is changed to aqua (as
            will all headers within a "container2" div) and all text within p elements within a "container2" div are
            automatically made bold.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Example 5</h2>
        <p>
            This example shows that colours can be defined in multiple ways, as in the CSS the names for each will be
            different colours and use the respective methods. The methods are <span class="RGB">Red/Green/Blue</span>,
            <span class="HEX">hex code</span>, <span class="HSL">Hue/Saturation/Lightness</span>, <span
                class="RGBA">Red/Green/Blue/Alpha</span>, <span class="HSLA">Hue/Saturation/Lightness/Alpha</span>, and
            <span class="colour-name">colour name</span>. Colour can be applied to text, the background, to a border, 
            or to many other things for different effects.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            - <span class="RGB">Red/Green/Blue</span> (or RGB) works by providing a value from 0 to 255 for the channels
            of red green and blue, which is how light combines into various colours as those are the primary colours of
            light (or "additive colour mixing"). This is also used by <span class="RGBA">Red/Green/Blue/Alpha</span> (or
            RGBA) but the added channel "Alpha" is used for transparency, with a value from 0.0 (completely transparent)
            to 1.0 (fully opaque).
        </p>
        <p>
            - <span class="HEX">Hex code</span> is one of the most used ways to describe colour for computers. It is
            seen as a # symbol followed by 6 "digits" of haxadecimal (numbers form 0-9 and letters from a-f to represent
            numbers from 10-15, with 10 in hexadecimal being the same as 16 in decimal). Each group of 2 digits is used
            for the same channels as RGB in order. So since the colour being used to represent hex codes in this example
            is #3aefeb it is equivalent to an RGB value of [58,239,235] which makes it the light blue/green colour that
            you see. Hex codes are also able to use the alpha channel by adding another 2 digits to the code, with
            higher values being more opaque and lower values being more transparent.
        </p>
        <p>
            - <span class="HSL">Hue/Saturation/Lightness</span> (HSL) and <span
                class="HSLA">Hue/Saturation/Lightness/Alpha</span> (HSLA) are in contrast less widely used. The value
            for Hue goes through each colour ranging from 0 to 359 (0 is the same as 360, being red, and all other
            values are a different part of the light spectrum), and the Saturation and Lightness values range from 0% to
            100%. HSLA is like RGBA in which it also adds in the Alpha channel, with the same value range.
        </p>
        <p>
            - The web also has 140 <span class="colour-name">colour names</span> that are supported by all browsers,
            which are symbols pointing to predefined hex code values. The colour used to represent colour names for this
            example is magenta, which means it is the equivalent of #ff00ff.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container3">
        <h2>Example 6</h2>
        <p>
            This example shows that it is also possible to use an image for a background in a container instead of just a colour.
            <br><br>
            The background image is also capable of being repeated (such as for a tileable pattern you want to use for a given box or container) or it can be set to not do so. It is also possible to only set it to repeat either horizontally or vertically.
            <br><br>
            If the background is set to not be repeated, then the rest of the backgorund will be set to look the same as the background behind the element being assigned an image, unless it is also given a background colour, which will show behind the image so a background colour would only show if the image is either transparent or doesn't fill the whole box similar to how this one has a sunset that doesn't fill the box.
            <br><br>
            There is also a property for changing the size of the background, so it could make a background image match the size of the element it is assigned to. This is set to "contain" in this example so that the image is made larger so that its height matches the container while keeping the same proportions so the width doesn't make it look squashed or stretched.
        </p>
        <p>
            This example also gives the text a dark shadow so that it is somewhat easier to read with the image behind it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container4">
        <h2>Example 7</h2>
        <p>
            Borders can be given to elements, and can be styled in many ways. The other examples don't have a border, while this one shoes the border styled as dashed while being cyan in colour. All examples also have a border radius which rounds the corners of the boxes, making them smoother to look at. A short hand property is also available to combine each border property at once (ordered as width, style, colour).
            <br><br>
            The border width is also able to be changed, so that it can be made to stand out more or to be more subtle.
            <br><br>
            Borders can also be styled to be hidden in case an element you don't want to have a border is inheriting one from somewhere else.
            <br><br>
            Each separate side of the border is capable of being defined separately for each property (such as if you wanted the bottom border to be a double line)
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container auto-margin">
        <h2>Example 8</h2>
        <p>
            Margins change the position of the element they are applied to. This example shows the margin changed so that the left and right margins have the value auto, which causes the container to be rendered in the center of the page. It also has a larger gap between it and the other examples.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container big-padding">
        <h2>Example 9</h2>
        <p>
            Padding is used for setting the distance between the edge of the container and the content. This example shows a larger padding than the rest of the examples.
            <br>
            It is possible to apply padding to only specific sides, although I am using the shorthand to apply 40px of padding to the top and bottom, while applying 100px padding to the left and right. This makes the container for this example wider than the others.
