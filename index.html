    <h1>CSS Examples</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>First Example</h2>
        <p>
            The default background colour and text colour has been changed within the CSS for the html tag,
            creating a dark-mode style appearance.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Second Example</h2>
        <p>
            I have created CSS for a div with the class "container" to create a slightly lighter box than the main background colour which visually separates each CSS example. They fit the sizze of the contents, with a width up to a maximum of 50% of the window width. They also have a rounnded border and a dropshadow to make them stand out more on the background of the page.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2 id="head2-change-1">Third Example</h2>
        <h2>[Original h2 size]</h2>
        <p>
            I have made a change to the CSS for the above headding ("Third Example") to make it larger than a normal
            instance of the h2 tag (provided for reference).
